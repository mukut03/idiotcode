"10,000 Men Lyrics[Intro]
Ten thousand men on a hill
Ten thousand men on a hill
Some of ’m going’ down, some of ’m gonna get killed

[Verse 1]
Ten thousand men dressed in Oxford blue
Ten thousand men dressed in Oxford blue
Drumming in the morning, in the evening they’ll be coming for you

[Verse 2]
Ten thousand men on the move
Ten thousand men on the move
None of them doing nothin’ that your mama wouldn’t disapprove
[Verse 3]
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold
All clean shaven, all coming in from the cold

[Verse 4]
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Let me eat off his head so you can really see!

[Verse 5]
Ten thousand women all dressed in white
Ten thousand women all dressed in white
Standing at my window wishing me Goodnight

[Verse 6]
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail
Each one of ’m got seven wives, each one of ’m just out of jail

[Verse 7]
Ten thousand women all sweepin’ my room
Ten thousand women all sweepin’ my room
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom

[Outro]
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea!
Baby, thank you for my tea!
It’s so sweet of you to be so nice to meEmbed","2 X 2 Lyrics[Intro]
One by one, they followed the sun
One by one, until there were none
Two by two, to their lovers they flew
Two by two, into the foggy dew
Three by three, they danced on the sea
Four by four, they danced on the shore
Five by five, they tried to survive
Six by six, they were playing with tricks

[Verse 1]
How many paths did they try and fail?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
How much poison did they inhale?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
[Verse 2]
Seven by seven, they headed for heaven
Eight by eight, they got to the gate
Nine by nine, they drank the wine
Ten by ten, they drank it again

[Verse 3]
How many tomorrows have they given away?
How many compared to yesterday?
How many more without any reward?
How many more can they afford?

[Verse 4]
Two by two, they stepped into the ark
Two by two, they step in the dark
Three by three, they’re turning the key
Four by four, they turn it some more

[Outro]
One by one, they follow the sun
Two by two, to another rendezvousEmbed","32-20 Blues Lyrics[Chorus]
When I send for my baby, man, and she don't come
Send for my baby, man, and she don't come
All the doctors in Hot Springs sure ain't gonna help her none
If she gets unruly, thinks she don't want you
If she gets unruly and thinks she don't want you
Take my 32-20 now and break her half in two
She got a .38 special, but I believe it's much too light
She got a .38 special, but I believe it's much too light
I got a 32-30, makes the camp all right
[Chorus]
If I send for my baby, man, and she don't come
Send for my baby, man, and she don't come
All the doctors in Hot Springs sure ain't gonna help her none
Gonna shoot my pistol, shoot my Gatling gun
Gonna shoot my pistol, got to shoot my Gatling gun
You made me love you, now your man has come
Aw baby, where'd you stay last night?
Aw baby, where'd you stay last night?
You got your hair all tangled and you ain't talking right
Her .38 special, boys, it do very well
Her .38 special, boys, it do very well
I got a 32-20 now it's a burning hell

[Chorus]
If I send for my baby, man, and she don't come
Send for my baby, man, and she don't come
All the doctors in, sure ain't gonna help her none
Hey hey baby, where'd you stay last night?
Hey hey baby, where'd you stay last night?
Didn't come home till the sun was shining bright
Oh boys, I just can't take my rest
Oh boys, I just can't take my rest
With this 32-20 laying up and down my breastEmbed","4th Time Around Lyrics[Verse 1]
When she said
“Don’t waste your words, they’re just lies”
I cried she was deaf
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes
And said, “What else you got left?”
Yeah, it was then that I got up to leave
But she said, “Don’t forget
Everybody must give something back
For something they get”
[Verse 2]
I stood there and hummed
I tapped on her drum I asked her ""How come?""
And she buttoned her boot
And straightened her suit
Then she said, “Don’t get cute”
So I forced my hands in my pockets
And felt with my thumbs
And gallantly handed her
My very last piece of gum

[Verse 3]
She threw me outside
I stood in the dirt where everyone walked
And after finding out I’d
Forgotten my shirt
I went back and knocked
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it
And I tried to make sense
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair
That leaned up against

[Verse 4]
Her Jamaican rum
And when she did come, I asked her for some
She said, “No, dear”
I said, “Your words aren’t clear
You’d better spit out your gum”
She screamed 'til her face got so red
Then she fell on the floor
And I covered her up and then
Thought I’d go look through her drawer
[Verse 5]
And when I was through
I filled up my shoe
And brought it to you
And you, you took me in
You loved me then
You never wasted time
And I, I never took much
I never asked for your crutch
Now don’t ask for mine3Embed","900 Miles from My Home LyricsBut I'm down here on this track
Not a shirt upon my back
I will sell to you this island that I own
Yes I feed the mouths I took
But as down winds on the brook
Lord I'm 900 miles from my home

If my old lady she says so
I'll railroad no more
Sidetrack this engine but I still roam
Yes I've given in my call
I've gladly given it all
'Cause I'm 900 miles from my home
If I get down by the bank And the river still does run
Yes and everything I see turns to foam
Even down on the ocean side
No she don't wade in just to bang my pride
'Cause I'm 900 miles from my home

Oh Mary don't you moan
Don't you weep on the ground Oh Mary don't you weep and don't you moan
If I get myself in line
I will be there in due time
'Cause I'm 900 miles from my homeEmbed","Abandoned Love Lyrics[George Harrison Cover][Verse 1]
I can see the turning of the key
I’ve been deceived by the clown inside of me
I thought that he was righteous but he’s vain
Oh, something’s a-telling me I wear the ball and chain

[Verse 2]
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost
He’s always off somewhere when I need him most
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill
But my heart is a-tellin’ me I love ya still
[Verse 3]
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
I see you in the streets, I begin to swoon
I love to see you dress before the mirror
Won’t you let me in your room one time ’fore I finally disappear?

[Verse 4]
Everybody’s wearing a disguise
To hide what they’ve got left behind their eyes
But me, I can’t cover what I am
Wherever the children go I’ll follow them

[Verse 5]
I march in the parade of liberty
But as long as I love you I’m not free
How long must I suffer such abuse
Won’t you let me see you smile one time before I turn you loose?

[Verse 6]
I’ve given up the game, I’ve got to leave
The pot of gold is only make-believe
The treasure can’t be found by men who search
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church

[Verse 7]
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed
I asked ya please to cross me off-a your list
My head tells me it’s time to make a change
But my heart is telling me I love ya but you’re strange
[Verse 8]
One more time at midnight, near the wall
Take off your heavy makeup and your shawl
Won’t you descend from the throne, from where you sit?
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it4Embed","Abraham, Martin, and John (Rehearsal) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Anybody here seen my old friend Abraham?
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed a lot of people but it seems the good they die young
You know I just looked around and he's gone

[Verse 2]
Anybody here seen my old friend John?
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed a lot of people but it seems the good they die young

Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed a lot of people but it seems the good they die young
I just looked around and he's gone

Didn't you love the things that they stood for?
Didn't they try to find some good for you and me?
And we'll be free
Some day soon, it's gonna be one day

Anybody here seen my old friend Bobby?
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed a lot of people, but it seems the good, they die young

Well, your railroad gate
You know I just can't jump it
Sometimes it gets so hard, you see
I just sitting here, beating on my trumpet
With all these promises you left for me
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?

[Verse 2]
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Yeah, when you knew I had some other place to be
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
[Bridge 1]
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously
But then, now again, not too many can be like you, fortunately

[Verse 3]
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary
But to live outside the law, you must be honest
I know you always say that you agree
Alright, so where are you tonight, sweet Marie?

[Bridge 2]
Well, I don't know how it happened
But the riverboat captain, he knows my fate
But everybody else, even yourself
They're just gonna have to wait

[Verse 4]
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets
The Persian drunkard, he follows me
Yes, I can take him to your house, but I can't unlock it
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?

[Verse 5]
Well, I been in jail when all the mail showed
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
And now I stand here lookin' at your yellow railroad
In the ruins of your balcony

I've had more chances to fly, and more places to fall
And it ain't that I'm wiser, it's only that I've spent more time with my back to the wall
And I've picked up a couple more years on you babe, and that's all

I've walked a couple more roads than you babe and that's all
And I'm tired of runnin' while you're only learning to crawl
And you're heading somewhere, but I've been to somewhere and found it was nowhere at all
And I've picked up a couple more years on you babe, and that's all

Now saying goodbye girl, don't never come easy at all
But you've gotta fly 'cause you're hearing them young voices call
And someday when you're older you'll smile at a man strong and tall
And you'll say I've got a couple more years on you babe and that's all
You'll say I've got a couple more years on you babe, and that's all

Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
I’ve stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I’ve walked and I’ve crawled on six crooked highways
I’ve stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I’ve been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I’ve been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard

[Chorus]
And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall
[Verse 2]
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleeding
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten-thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children

[Chorus]
And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall

[Verse 3]
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing
I heard ten-thousand whispering and nobody listening
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley

And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall

[Verse 4]
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman, her body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded in hatred

[Chorus]
And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall

[Verse 5]
And what will you do now, my blue-eyed son?
And what will you do now, my darling young one?
I’m a-going back out ’fore the rain starts a-falling
I’ll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
And the executioner’s face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, where none is the number
And I’ll tell it, and speak it, and think it, and breathe it
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it
Then I’ll stand on the ocean until I start sinking
But I’ll know my song well before I start singing

But I ain’t gonna go to hell for anybody

It don't matter 'bout his position, it don't matter 'bout his lifestyle
Talk about perfection, I ain't never seen none

Sometimes the devil likes to drive you from the neighborhood
He'll even work his ways through those whose intentions are good
Some like to worship on the moon, others are worshipping the sun
And there ain't no man righteous, no not one

Look around, ya see so many social hypocrites
Like to make rules for others while they do just the opposite
You can't get to glory by the raising and the lowering of no flag
Put your goodness next to God's and it comes out like a filthy rag
In a city of darkness there's no need of the sun
And there ain't no man righteous, no not one

Done so many evil things in the name of love that it's a crying shame
I never did see no fire that could put out a flame

Pull your hat down, baby, pull the wool down over your eyes
Keep a-talking, baby, 'til you run right out of alibis
Someday you'll account for all the deeds that you done
Well, there ain't no man righteous, no not one

God got the power, man has got his vanity
Man gotta choose before God can set him free
Don't you know there's nothing new that's under the sun?
Well, there ain't no man righteous, no not one

Just say that I trusted in God and that Christ was in me
Say He defeated the devil, He was God's chosen Son

As I walked out tonight in the mystic garden
The wounded flowers were danglin' from the vine
I was passin' by yon cool and crystal fountain
Someone hit me from behind

Ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
Through this weary world of woe
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
No one on earth would ever know

They say prayer has the power to help
So pray from the mother
In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell

But oh, mother, things ain't goin' well

Through the world mysterious and vague
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
Walkin' a'through the cities of the plague

Well, the whole world is filled with speculation
The whole wide world which people say is round
They will tear your mind away from contemplation
They will jump on your misfortune when you're down

Eatin' hog-eyed grease in a hog-eyed town

They approve of me and share my code
I practice a faith that's been long abandoned
Ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road

The sufferin' is unending
Every nook and cranny has its tears
I'm a'not playin', I'm not pretending
I'm not nursin' any superfluous fears

[Verse 16]
Ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
Walkin' ever since the other night
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
Walkin' ‘til I'ma clean outta sight

[Verse 17]
As I walked out in the mystic garden
On a hot summer day, a hot summer lawn
""Excuse me, ma'am, I beg your pardon
There's no one here, the gardener is gone""

[Verse 18]
Ain't talkin', a'just a'walkin'
Up the road around the bend
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
In the last outback, at the world's endEmbed","Alberta #1 Lyrics[Verse 1]
Alberta let your hair hang low
Alberta let your hair hang low
I'll give you more gold
Than your apron can hold
If you'd only let your hair hang low

Alberta what's on your mind

You keep me worried and bothered
All of the time

Oh my heart is so sad
Cause I want you so bad
Alberta don't you treat me unkind

""There must be some way out of here""
Said the joker to the thief
""There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth""

[Verse 2]
""No reason to get excited""
The thief, he kindly spoke
""There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late""
[Verse 3]
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside, in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind began to howl42Embed"
